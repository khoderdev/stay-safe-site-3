    comments: "Top source of foodborne illness; some people develop antibodies to it, but others do not. In people with compromised immune systems, it may spread to the bloodstream and cause sepsis; may lead to arthritis or to GBS, a rare nerve disorder causing paralysis; 40% of GBS in the United States is caused by campylo-bacteriosis and affects the nerves of the body, beginning several weeks after the diarrheal illness; can lead to paralysis that lasts several weeks and usually requires intensive care. If untreated, these symptoms may progress to cause paralysis of the arms, legs, trunk, and respiratory muscles; long-term ventilator support may be needed."
